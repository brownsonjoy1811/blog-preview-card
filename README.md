## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my knowledge of CSS hover effects and structuring a simple blog preview card.

#### Example Code:
```css
.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
  transition: 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Continued Development

In the future, I want to explore:
- Animations using JavaScript for smoother effects
- Accessibility improvements
- Optimized CSS techniques

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Great resource for improving CSS skills.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Detailed documentation on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
